# React ND Mobile Flashcards

## What is this?
This is the last project of React Nanodegree on Udacity. *UdaciCards* allows users to create new deck, browse existing decks, and add new flash card to a deck. Users can also quiz themselves using the app.

## What did I use?
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/blog/2018/11/17/react-navigation-3.0.html)

## How to use the app?
To run the App, you first need to run the following command to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

After that, run the following command to start the app.

```bash
npm start
```

If you prefer Yarn, you can use the following command instead:
```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

## Testing
I tested the App on Android only (using Expo on a Samsung Galaxy S8). I will add iOS support later.
